# SOM_package

This package is in development but for now it has the basic tools we need to do the following:
- Make data into datacubes that can be processed and which can construct an SOM out of it. (Data_to_NeuroScope_format)
- Recall the resulting datacube for analysis (SOM_recall file)
- Make plots (Plotting)
- Recall data using an existing datacube (SOM_recall)

In the future I intend to add functionality to train an SOM with a variaety of choices and improving/expanding upon the plotting functions which are currently available.
